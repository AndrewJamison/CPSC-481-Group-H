<h2>Identify Project Idea</h2>

<p>Everyone uses washrooms, that’s plain enough to see. However, what is it that people seek out in a washroom? Are factors of a washroom important enough to warrant a person going out of their way to go to a washroom with preferred features? Our app aims to identify the features that people want in a washrooms and give an easy method of locating these washrooms. The scope of the application is currently targeted at just a University campus but the goal of the design implementation is that it allows for usability on a larger scale. </p>

	<p>The system is meant to be used in a quick and efficient manner. If a user wants to find a bathroom with a certain feature such as a paper towel dispenser, a simple search should return nearby results that match the parameters of the users search. It is expected that the primary user of the app is someone who wants to quickly find a washroom. As such, the system is designed in a way such that it is intuitive and minimalistic in order to maintain simplicity.</p>

<p> A secondary use of the system is that it gives building owners data about their washrooms. Data is versatile and can be used in numerous ways. For instance, if a building owner or administrator wants to renovate a washroom, using the data from this app, effective changes can be made that target the concerns and necessities of regular users. </p>

<p>Additionally, there is also the prospect of a secondary user in the form of an advertiser. Advertisers could potentially use the system as a platform to market their goods and services. This would be done in a standard method where advertisers, purchase software real estate for their advertisements.</p>


<h2>Part 2: provide a list of stakeholders, and describe them as they relate to the design of the system</h2>

    <p>The washroom finder app is marketable to a large variety of people as every person at some point throughout their busy day has to use the washroom. The requirement is what makes the idea so easy for people to be invested in. Many regular people would like to know what the best bathroom around is as no one ever wants to have to go in a dirty bathroom that does not feel comfortable. This is why the bathroom finder app is such a marketable product. For the sake of the small scale of the project being limited to University of Calgary our main investor who would help sponsor this project would be UofC. We believe UofC would be our biggest investor as they would gain a lot of insight on what is the cleanest bathroom, what they can do to improve their low rated bathrooms and what was wrong with them in the first place so the problem can be prevented. Other potential investments and the bulk of revenue we expect after our small scale project starts to expand is ad revenue. Ads relate to the design of the system as we would have to adjust our app design to fit ads on our app and not cover any vital information which can be a huge pain if ads are an afterthought to app design. Another margin for profit is big data companies as we acquire users we will have a list of preferences for people and what is the most prefered design which would be amazing for architecture firms moving forward, thus interest in buying the information we are attempting to sell. Thus the design and template we use to acquire information has to be succinct and easy to understand. Janitorial services will also have some sort of stake in this project as it is a quick and simple way to see if your employees are doing a decent job keeping the bathroom clean or if a change of cleaning scheduling has to occur. The bathroom owners will be able to see every comment and evaluation giving them a clear and concise idea of what is important to the user of their washroom and why the user had a good/bad experience. Students will be the primary user of this app at the launch and being a student myself time is my most valuable asset knowing this is the case we know when designing the system the questions asked have to be easy and quick to answer not involving much thinking and the rating process take no longer than 40 seconds unless making an effort to comment. </p>


<h2>Part 3
The two research methods we have chosen are Behavioral Archaeology and use of a survey. </h2>

<h3>Why?:</h3><p>
When it comes to designing the system, first and foremost, it is crucial for us to identify any features that people want in a washroom. Accomplishing this is done best by simply asking survey takers to tell us about whether they think a list factor is important or not. This method allows for a succinct description of what users want. This brings us to our use of Behavioral Archaeology, it is simple to ask users what they prefer via survey but the scope of our questions may not cover all aspects entirely, or perhaps a user may unconsciously prefer a method that they would not even think to mention. Picture this, if someone uses a paper towel to open a washroom door then they would obviously prefer to have a garbage can near the door then. Behavioral Archaeology allows for us to find trends similar to the aforementioned that our survey won’t cover entirely. Thus the combination of these two user research methods results in a detailed analysis of the current bathrooms and how they can be improved upon. </p>

<h3>Findings from the Survey:</h3>
 The findings of our survey were quite interesting as we were able to probe approximately 16 people for what they thought was important or not important in a washroom. We asked not only questions based on the layout and design but also the choices of equipment in the bathroom. Our findings found that privacy when using the washroom is the biggest concern for people when going, this makes sense as no one wants people to see someone doing their business. Relating to privacy, we also polled for preference on how busy you want your bathroom to be, most people said they would go out of their way to avoid busy bathrooms and prefer to be at a quieter  bathroom. Another interesting piece of data is people prefer not to have the newer technology in their bathrooms! Hand dryers and automatic flush, as a majority, did not appreciate having them! We find this interesting as this was designed to be a quality of life change but has perhaps had an opposite effect. We also polled people on aesthetics of bathrooms, most thought that an aesthetically pleasing bathroom gave a better experience than one which is not. For example, people prefered marble counters over the standard acrylic resin countertops. As part of this research we also found that many people did not care if urinals were partitioned, one can assume this is partially privacy related, but must also have something to do with the aesthetics of the walls. Another part of aesthetics that people enjoyed was the amount of space given between stalls and urinals the more space the better was the consensus meaning a more negative space is prefered. 
Findings via Behavioral Archaeology:
From our observations we found that most washrooms were not clean at approximately 11 am. We also found that most toilet paper dispensers were too low for use. We also discovered that almost all layouts had similar structure thus the only difference between bathrooms was stall numbers and sinks etc. </p>
 
<p>
From our observations we found that most washrooms
were for the most part well designed. And adequately spaced apart.
</p>
<h4>  such design features include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The number of stalls was appropriate for the
perceived foot traffic around the area</li>
  <li>the number of sinks was also appropriate for the
    perceived capacity of the washroom.</li>
  <li>There were always soap dispensers</li>
  <li>The number of soap dispensers was about the same as the number of sinks available.</li>
  <li>Garbage cans were placed near the exit(s) and paper towel dispensers.</li>
  <li>There was always a way for the users to dry their hands</li>
  </ul>
<p>All washrooms meet the requirement of allowing a user to do their business.  If a user only valued the core functionality of a washroom, then the greatest predictor would be proximity to the washroom. </p>
<p>note that soap is not common in east asian washrooms.</p>

<p>However, not all the washrooms were the same.</p>
<h4>We noticed some differences between the washrooms that might affect user preference:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Not all washrooms had paper towel dispensers, but they all provided a way to dry the users hands
some washroom have more paper towel dispensers than others</li>
<li>Not all washroom had a feature to leave the washroom without touching the door, for example there was no door or there was a automatic door.</li>
   <li>Some of the washrooms that don't have an automatic door also do not have paper towels</li>
<li>Not all washroom have automatic flush.</li>
<li>washroom stall space was not uniform for non handicap stall. some washrooms have much larger normal stalls</li>
<li>some washrooms have stalls that offer more privacy than others</li>
<li>some washrooms have dividers between urinals</li>

<p>While all washrooms have the basic functionality of a washroom, we see that differences exists.
 There were washrooms that were out of the way, yet there were signs that there was more user than what the area they were in would suggest, such as paper towel and soap depletion.

Perhaps user experience can be improved if a user could search for washrooms that meet
 the user's preferences and goals for washroom use.</p>

<h3>Reflections:</h3>
  <p>Both user research methods resulted in valuable data, however there were some shortcomings. Namely, use of a survey is heavily dependent on participation. With no incentive to participate, survey results were on a lower end scale than expected. In the event that another survey should be needed, it would be a good idea to include incentive to take it so that more thought is put in and more results obtained. Regarding the behavioral archaeology method, findings were useful and interesting, however sparse. Despite looking at different types of washrooms, ranging sizes and locations, many of the observations are generally shared amongst the washrooms. </p>
<h4>Six task descriptions of how the system will be used:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>User needs to use the washroom but has a particular affinity to being alone in a washroom. Using our system they could pinpoint the location of a washroom that generally offers greatest privacy.</li>
  <li>A building owner would like to make improvements to their washrooms, using the system they could explicitly find features that users want in the washroom.</li>
  <li>A building owner wants to make renovations to the building and wants to know which areas of the building to close off. The data measure of foot traffic can be used to monitor pedestrian traffic throughout the building.</li>
  <li>An advertiser wishes to target an audience of people who uses washrooms, which is everyone.</li>
  <li>A potential building owner would like to make note of the key features that a washroom has in order to please the occupants. Using our system, the most sought after features become easily identifiable</li>
  <li>A tourist in a foreign location is unsure of where to find a nearby washroom. Using our system the nearest one can be easily found.</li>
  </ul>
